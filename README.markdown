# Gaming Project #

**Find the treasure**

## TODO ##

* Make 'levels' (campaign) & Choice of location (2-3 options)
* Make more dist options (3 total, rest for FUTURE WORK)
* Check random goal location function (seems always to be towards NE-> if only positive this makes sense in NL)
* Make Progress Bar (self & Opponent)
* Remove 1 level
* Make Flag/Treasure images
* Make report
* Initiation of dist, heat, compass (FUTURE WORK)
* Fancy up the stuff: intro screen, menu, HUD (FUTURE WORK)
* perhaps introduce hint system (street name, snap shot etc.) (FUTURE WORK)

## HOWTO ##

* To enable location sharing on own computer in Chrome:
  * run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from this folder
  * Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/GSVfindthetreasure.html`
